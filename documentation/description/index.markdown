### In This Section ###

This section describes the Sandpiper Language, in terms friendly to the average programmer. Until the rigorous language reference is available, this description serves as the standard definition of Sandpiper.

We will define the language and runtime as needed to build from a simple hello-world program into a well-functioning console app. If you’re in a tutorialish mood, you ought to [head right over to the first section and see how we start by calling some methods][oam].

### Notes ###

Note that this documentation is a work in progress, published as we work on it. Note also that Sandpiper itself is a work in progress, and so until the first beta release, everything will be subject to change.

This site isn’t a wiki. It’s *way better* than a wiki: [it’s right there on GitHub][spgh]. You’re totally invited to help work on the documentation, if that’s your sort of thing.
